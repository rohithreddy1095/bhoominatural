## The Food Forest

### Concept
"I designed a food forest that would be self-sufficient and not require external inputs. We named it Bhoomi Natural Farms." - Shyam Singh Rod

### Size & Scale
- Total Area: 10 acres
- Started: 2016 with 2 acres, expanded over the years
- Over 40 varieties of crops grown

### Farming Practices
- **Method:** Natural farming (no chemicals or external inputs)
- **Philosophy:** Self-sufficient food forest ecosystem
- **Sustainability:** Chemical-free, organic approach
- **Biodiversity:** Diverse crop varieties grown together
- **Inputs:** Only cow dung and cow urine used to enrich soil with nutrients and beneficial bacteria
- **No External Inputs:** No outside manure or fertilizer used

### Planting Methodology

**Dense Planting Approach:**
Unlike conventional farms with widely spaced trees, Bhoomi Natural uses intensive planting:
- Approximately 2,500 trees planted over the initial 2 acres
- Each tree type helps sustain other tree types
- Polyculture design creates mutual support system

**Strategic Spacing:**
- Litchi plants: 30 feet apart
- Guava trees: 15 feet apart
- Papaya and banana: Planted between larger fruit trees
- Other varieties: Strategically placed for optimal ecosystem function

**Food Forest Design:**
- Multi-layered canopy structure
- Closely planted trees of various fruits and vegetables
- Each species contributes to overall ecosystem health
- Mimics natural forest density and diversity

**Soil Management:**
- Natural composting from plant matter
- Cow dung for nutrient enrichment
- Cow urine for soil bacteria and pest management
- Self-regenerating soil fertility
