 "Namaste and welcome back to Bhoomi Natural Farm! Today, we're excited to share with you the progress of our multilayer sustainable food forest after 4 months of growth!"
 "As you may recall, we started this food forest journey with a vision to create a thriving ecosystem that produces a diverse range of fruits and vegetables. We designed a multilayer system with a mix of trees, shrubs, and ground covers to maximize space and biodiversity."
"Let's take a walk through the forest and see how our plants are doing! We have mangoes, papayas, bananas, turmeric, ginger, and many more. Look at the growth of these papayas! They're already bearing fruit!"

 "That's it for today's update! We're thrilled with the progress of our food forest and can't wait to see what the future holds. Thanks for joining us on this journey and we'll see you in the next video!"
