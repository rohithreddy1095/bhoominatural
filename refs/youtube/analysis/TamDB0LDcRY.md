Description:
Join us on an incredible journey as we take you through the remarkable transformation of a waste land into a lush Food Forest and Pond Oasis in Kolkata, India, by Bhoomi Natural!

The Story:
In early 2025, we embarked on a mission to revive a neglected plot of land, overrun with plastic, polythene, and garbage. The polluted pond was choked with waste, and the surrounding area was barren. We rolled up our sleeves, cleaned up the mess, and set out to create something extraordinary!

*The Transformation:*
We designed a vibrant Food Forest, planting a diverse range of fruits (including exotic varieties), vegetables, spices, and medicinal plants. The polluted pond was rejuvenated, and we introduced vetiver on the slopes to naturally clean the water. Coconut, banana, and arecanut palms now thrive, adding to the oasis's beauty.

Key Highlights:

- Transformation of a waste land into a thriving ecosystem
- Revival of a polluted pond into a crystal-clear oasis
- Diverse planting of fruits, veggies, spices, and medicinal plants
- Sustainable practices for water purification and land rejuvenation

*Watch as we breathe life into this once-neglected land, creating a haven for nature, sustainability, and community! 😊
