Elaichi bananas, also known as Yelakki in Bengaluru are a miniature banana variety that are sweeter than regular bananas. They are named for their small size, which translates to "cardamom" in Yelakki. Elaichi bananas are about three to four inches long, have smooth yellow skin, and a creamy texture. When ripe, they have a rich, sweet flavor with vanilla and caramel undertones.
